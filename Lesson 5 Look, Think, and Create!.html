It impresses us with its<br/>beauty and supplies us with everything we need to<br/>survive. It also provides some people with the<br/>inspiration to create things in a new way. The act of<br/>creating things based on nature is called<br/>“biomimicry.”   This term is derived from the Greek<br/>words       </span><span class="s2">bios</span>, meaning “life,” and <span class="s2">mimesis</span><span>, meaning<br/>“imitation.”</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 132%;text-align: left;"><span>Architects who use biomimicry look at nature as an<br/>incredibly successful engineer who has already come<br/>up with answers to some of the problems they now<br/>face. They carefully study plants, animals, and other<br/>aspects of nature to learn how they work. As a<br/>result, they have been able to find some innovative<br/>solutions to engineering and architectural challenges.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Curving Beauty of Nature</h2><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 132%;text-align: left;"><span>The Sagrada Familia is an enormous church in<br/>Barcelona, Spain. Designed by the world-famous<br/>architect Antoni Gaudi, the church is one of the most<br/>prominent buildings in the world. Construction of this<br/>remarkable building began in 1882, and Gaudi took<br/>over responsibility for its design in 1883. Believe it or<br/>not, the building is still under construction. Some<br/>people love the Sagrada Familia and others hate it,<br/>but nearly everyone is fascinated by its unique<br/>design.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 138%;text-align: left;"><span>Gaudi believed that all architects should look to<br/>nature for inspiration. He preferred the curves found<br/>in natural objects to the straight lines found in<br/>artificial ones. This preference can be seen in all his<br/>buildings, including the Sagrada Familia. Many parts<br/>of      the church incorporate images and forms from<br/>nature. For example, the church’s spires are topped<br/>with spheres that resemble fruits. There are also<br/>turtles carved into the stone bases of columns and<br/>spiral stairs that resemble the shells of sea creatures.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 138%;text-align: left;"><span>Perhaps the most impressive feature of the Sagrada<br/>Familia is the ceiling. Gaudi designed the columns<br/>inside the church to resemble trees and branches, so<br/>visitors who look up can feel as if they were<br/>standing in a great forest. The light that comes<br/>through the small holes all over the ceiling even<br/>resembles the light beaming through leaves in a<br/>forest. These tree-like columns are not just for<br/>decoration, though. Inspired by trees, Gaudi gave the<br/>columns a single base that splits off into branches<br/>near the top. This allows them to support the roof<br/>better by distributing its weight evenly. Because<br/>Gaudi recognized the superiority of natural forms, he<br/>was able to design a building that is both beautiful<br/>and functional.</span></p><h2 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A Lesson from Insects</h2><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 135%;text-align: left;"><span>The Eastgate Centre is an office building and<br/>shopping complex in Harare, Zimbabwe. Built in 1996,<br/>it might not be as visually impressive as the Sagrada<br/>Familia. However, the building is an excellent example<br/>of biomimicry. Due to the hot climate of Harare, air<br/>conditioning systems can be very costly to install,<br/>run,      and maintain. To solve this problem, the<br/>building’s architect, Mick Pearce, turned to *termite<br/>mounds for an alternative.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 135%;text-align: left;"><span>Termite mounds are large structures built by certain<br/>termite species. Scientists believe that the mounds<br/>stay cool due to a constant flow of air. Each mound<br/>has a network of holes referred to as chimneys. It<br/>has a large central chimney and smaller outer<br/>chimneys that are close to the ground. The heat<br/>generated by the daily activity of the termites rises<br/>up through the central chimney, eventually escaping<br/>through the top of the mound. In the meantime,<br/>cooler air is pulled in through the smaller chimneys,<br/>keeping the termites’ home at a comfortable<br/>temperature during the hot day.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 135%;text-align: left;"><span>Also, the soil surrounding the mound absorbs heat in<br/>the hot daytime hours. Therefore, the temperature<br/>inside the mound does not increase greatly and stays<br/>relatively cool. At night, when the outside<br/>temperature goes down, the heat is finally released.<br/>This process inspired Pearce to design an innovative<br/>climate control system.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 127%;text-align: left;"><span>The Eastgate Centre was constructed without a<br/>conventional cooling system. Instead, Pearce used<br/>building materials that can store large amounts of<br/>heat. The floors and walls of the building absorb<br/>heat during the day, just like the soil of a termite<br/>mound. The heat is released at night, and the walls<br/>cool down, ready to store heat again by the next<br/>morning.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 127%;text-align: left;"><span>The structure of the building also helps keep the<br/>building cool. There are openings near the base of<br/>the building, and outside air comes into the building<br/>through them. This air is moved through the building<br/>by a system of automatic fans. Eventually, the air,<br/>along with heat generated by human activity during<br/>the day, rises upward through the building’s internal<br/>open spaces and is released through chimneys on<br/>the roof.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 127%;text-align: left;"><span>As a result, the building has not only cool<br/>temperatures but also fresh air. More importantly, the<br/>Eastgate Centre uses far less energy than other<br/>buildings, which saves money and helps protect the<br/>environment from pollution. Without the inspiration<br/>Pearce received from tiny termites, none of this<br/>would have been possible.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 127%;text-align: left;"><span>Using biomimicry in architecture is just one way that<br/>humans are utilizing the lessons of nature to improve<br/>the way we do things. Biomimicry is also being used<br/>to solve problems in the fields of robotics,<br/>agriculture, and many others. Imitating the ideas of<br/>nature not only helps solve problems, but it also<br/>makes us feel closer to nature. As a result, humans<br/>are more likely to stop destroying the environment<br/>and start becoming part of it instead.</span></p></body></html>
