This may sound strange, but it is actually true.<br/>An everyday action that helps us save energy can<br/>also help save an endangered species. How does this<br/>work? Let’s take a look.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h3 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A Species in Danger</h3><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 124%;text-align: left;"><span>Tigers, one of the world’s largest *feline species, have<br/>long been the kings of Asia’s forests. Despite being<br/>the dominant predators of their habitats, they move<br/>silently and remain unseen most of the time. Imagine<br/>how ancient people must have felt when<br/>encountering tigers in the wild! It is no surprise that<br/>tigers have been feared and worshipped by humans<br/>for centuries, standing as symbols of power and<br/>courage. The fact that ancient rock paintings feature<br/>images of tigers shows how closely tigers have been<br/>related to humans throughout history.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 124%;text-align: left;"><span>At one time, tigers were found all across Asia, from<br/>Korea to Turkey. However, the world’s tiger<br/>population has been shrinking rapidly. Illegal hunting<br/>and habitat loss are the main reasons behind this<br/>decrease. At the start of the 20th century, it was<br/>estimated that there were approximately 100,000 wild<br/>tigers. In recent years, however, three of the nine<br/>subspecies of tigers have become extinct.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 124%;text-align: left;"><span>In fact, it is now estimated that there are fewer than<br/>4,000 tigers living in the wild. Some experts even<br/>predict that the last of the world’s wild tigers will<br/>disappear within the next 10 years.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h3 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Our Interconnected World</h3><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 119%;text-align: left;"><span>It would be very sad if there were no more wild<br/>tigers. Would it really matter, though? After all, we<br/>could still see them in zoos or watch programs<br/>about them on TV. Shouldn’t we be more worried<br/>about protecting human beings? The fact is, however,<br/>that we need to protect tigers in order to protect<br/>ourselves. This is because all of Earth’s species are<br/>interconnected.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 119%;text-align: left;"><span>Think about what would happen if tigers became<br/>extinct. Existing at the top of the food chain, they<br/>maintain the populations of animals they prey on,<br/>such       as deer and boar. Without tigers, these species<br/>would rapidly increase in number. As a result, their<br/>food source, vegetation, would begin to disappear.<br/>This would cause birds and insects to lose their<br/>homes, and bigger animals that prey on them would<br/>soon run out of food. Eventually, the entire<br/>ecosystem would be affected. Humans are no<br/>exception,        as we rely on nature for everything we<br/>need        to survive, including air, food, and water. This is<br/>how the disappearance of a single species can<br/>threaten the whole planet.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 17pt;text-align: left;">Now imagine what would happen if we made the</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 119%;text-align: left;"><span>effort to save tigers. Tigers are considered an<br/>“umbrella species.” This is an ecological term<br/>referring         to species that live in a large area<br/>containing        a variety of different ecosystems. If we<br/>choose       to protect these species, we must conserve<br/>their habitat. As a result, the other species that share<br/>this habitat, including trees and insects, are protected<br/>too, as if there were a large umbrella being held<br/>over them.</span></p><h3 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Small Efforts with Big Results</h3><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 138%;text-align: left;"><span>Now, it is obvious that we must protect tigers. You<br/>may, however, still wonder how switching off the<br/>lights helps. Well, the lights in our homes require<br/>electricity, and more than half of the world’s<br/>electricity    is created by burning fossil fuels. When<br/>fossil fuels are burned, carbon dioxide is released<br/>into the air, and this contributes to climate change.<br/>Climate change has a number of negative effects,<br/>including rising sea levels that threaten many parts<br/>of the world. One of these places, called the<br/>Sundarbans, is an area on the coast of Bangladesh<br/>inhabited by a large number of tigers. If Earth’s</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 18pt;text-align: left;">oceans continue to rise, this area could be wiped out</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 138%;text-align: left;"><span>and its tiger population could be reduced by as<br/>much as 96%. By conserving energy, however, we<br/>can slow climate change, and this will slow the rise<br/>of the oceans. So keep switching off the lights<br/>whenever you’re the last person to leave a room!<br/>You can also protect tigers when shopping. Many<br/>popular products, including chocolate, instant<br/>noodles, and soap, are made with palm oil.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 138%;text-align: left;"><span>Unfortunately, forests where tigers live are being<br/>destroyed to build more and more palm oil<br/>plantations.   Some palm oil, however, is produced in a<br/>more sustainable way. Products that use this<br/>environmentally friendly palm oil usually have a<br/>special              mark on the label. Look for it the next time<br/>you go shopping!</span></p><h3 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Get Involved</h3><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 138%;text-align: left;"><span>There are many other things you can do to protect<br/>tigers and other endangered species. You could<br/>volunteer at a nonprofit organization or share<br/>important information on social networking sites.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 138%;text-align: left;"><span>However small your actions may seem, they can help<br/>make a big difference. Most importantly, you must<br/>remember that we all share the same planet. If a<br/>single species disappears, every other living creature,<br/>including human beings, could be affected.</span></p></body></html>
