However, there have been many<br/>attempts to categorize people’s personalities. One of<br/>the most common methods divides people into two<br/>types, introverts and extroverts. According to this<br/>division, introverts tend to be drawn to the internal<br/>world of thoughts and feelings, while extroverts are<br/>drawn to the external world of people and activities.<br/>Introverts recharge their batteries by spending some<br/>time alone; extroverts need to recharge when they<br/>do not socialize enough.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 138%;text-align: left;"><span>Extroverts are good at performing tasks under<br/>pressure and coping with multiple jobs at once.<br/>Introverts, on the other hand, like to focus on one<br/>task at a time and can concentrate very well.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 137%;text-align: left;"><span>Extroverts tend to do assignments quickly. They make<br/>fast decisions and are comfortable with taking risks.<br/>Introverts often work more slowly and deliberately.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 137%;text-align: left;"><span>They think before they act, give up less easily, and<br/>work more accurately.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 138%;text-align: left;"><span>Based on all this information, you might think that<br/>introverts and extroverts do not get along. However,<br/>they actually work well together because their<br/>personalities complement each other. Sometimes they<br/>can even accomplish great things when they<br/>collaborate. Let’s take a look at some famous<br/>examples!</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h3 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 127%;text-align: left;"><span>Case One: Working Together for Civil Rights<br/></span><span class="p">On December 1, 1955, in the American city of<br/>Montgomery, Alabama, a black woman named Rosa<br/>Parks   got on a bus. At that time in Montgomery,<br/>buses were divided into two zones: one for black<br/>people and the other for white people. She took a<br/>seat   in the black zone and watched quietly as more<br/>and more passengers got on the bus. Soon, all the<br/>seats in the white zone were taken. Then the driver<br/>ordered her to give her seat to a white passenger.<br/>Rosa Parks was a shy, mild-mannered introvert. She<br/>avoided standing out in public or drawing attention<br/>to herself. However, she had the courage to resist<br/>injustice, so she answered calmly with a single<br/>word—“No.” The furious driver called the police, and<br/>she       was arrested.</span></h3><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 127%;text-align: left;"><span>Parks’s calm response to the situation impressed<br/>many people. Soon after, her quiet resistance came<br/>together with the inspirational speechmaking of<br/>Martin Luther King Jr. When 5,000 people assembled<br/>at a rally to support Parks’s act of courage, King<br/>made a speech to the crowd. He was an extrovert —<br/>assertive, sociable, and good at motivating people.<br/>“There comes a time when people get tired of being<br/>trampled,” he told them. “There comes a time when<br/>people get tired of being pushed out of the<br/>sunlight.” King was an amazing speaker, and his<br/>words filled the people with pride and hope. He then<br/>praised Parks’s bravery and hugged her. She stood<br/>silently. Her mere presence was enough to</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 17pt;text-align: left;">strengthen the crowd.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 138%;text-align: left;"><span>Rosa Parks’s act and Martin Luther King Jr.’s speech<br/>inspired Montgomery’s black community to boycott<br/>the buses, a crucial turning point in the struggle for<br/>civil rights. The boycott lasted for 381 days. It was a<br/>difficult time for everyone, but eventually the buses<br/>were integrated. Think about how the partnership of<br/>these two people accomplished this. A powerful<br/>speaker refusing to give up his seat on a bus would<br/>not have had the same effect. Similarly, Rosa Parks<br/>could not have excited the crowd at the rally with<br/>her words. When their introverted and extroverted<br/>traits were combined, however, his charisma attracted<br/>attention to her quiet bravery. In the end, this<br/>partnership had a huge impact on society.</span></p><h3 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Case Two: A Business Partnership</h3><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 127%;text-align: left;"><span>On June 29, 1975, Steve Wozniak tapped a few keys<br/>on his keyboard, and letters appeared on a screen.<br/>He had just created a personal computer that<br/>allowed people to type on a keyboard and see the<br/>results on a monitor simultaneously. At the sight of<br/>the brilliant device, Steve Jobs suggested to Wozniak<br/>that they start a business.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 127%;text-align: left;"><span>Wozniak was a great inventor. When he partnered<br/>with Jobs, however, he was able to do much more.<br/>In fact, the two men formed one of the most<br/>famous partnerships of the digital era. Wozniak<br/>would come up with a clever engineering idea, and<br/>Jobs would find a way to polish, package, and sell it.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 127%;text-align: left;"><span>The two men had opposite personalities. Wozniak<br/>hated small talk and often worked alone. It was<br/>these features of his introverted personality that<br/>enabled him to focus on inventing things. Jobs, on<br/>the other hand, had outstanding social skills.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 127%;text-align: left;"><span>According to Wozniak, he was good at<br/>communicating with people. Wozniak was a shy<br/>inventor, whereas Jobs was a daring entrepreneur,<br/>but they were alike in that neither was afraid to face<br/>challenges that seemed impossible.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 127%;text-align: left;"><span>So which personality type is better? Obviously, the<br/>answer is neither. The world needs both introverts<br/>and extroverts, and they often make a terrific team.<br/>We simply need to respect different personalities as<br/>well as our own. Then, when we have a chance to<br/>work together, we might be able to do great things!</span></p></body></html>
