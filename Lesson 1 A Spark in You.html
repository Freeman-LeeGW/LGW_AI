In the 1970s, he</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 127%;text-align: left;"><span>worked at an English language boarding school in<br/>Argentina. One day he visited a beach and found a<br/>penguin that was injured and alone. Michell decided<br/>to  help the bird. He cleaned it, fed it, and even gave<br/>it a name—Juan Salvado. From that day on, Juan<br/>Salvado lived on the terrace of his room in the<br/>school dormitory. The following is part of the story,<br/>written by Tom Michell, about the penguin and a<br/>boy   at the school.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 127%;text-align: left;"><span>From the first day that I brought a penguin to live<br/>at the school, one student in particular wanted to<br/>help with his care. His name was Diego Gonzales.<br/>Diego was a shy boy who seemed to be frightened<br/>of his own shadow. He struggled with his classes,<br/>and none of the after-school activities seemed to suit<br/>him. He was neither strong nor athletic. On the<br/>rugby field, nobody passed the ball to him or<br/>involved him in the game, except to make fun of<br/>him.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 127%;text-align: left;"><span>Diego’s early education had not prepared him well<br/>for life at his new school. His knowledge of English<br/>was limited, so he avoided conversation. However,<br/>Diego enjoyed the company of Juan Salvado. Indeed,<br/>on the terrace, Diego could relax. He had some<br/>friends who also had trouble fitting in. Looking after<br/>Juan Salvado was good for those boys. They fed him<br/>fish, swept the terrace, and spent time with him.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 138%;text-align: left;"><span>One day, I took Juan Salvado to the school<br/>swimming pool with the boys. As soon as the other<br/>swimmers left, we brought Juan Salvado to the water<br/>to see if he would swim. Juan Salvado had been<br/>living at the school for several months by then.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 137%;text-align: left;"><span>However, in all that time, he had never been able to<br/>swim because his feathers had been damaged.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 138%;text-align: left;"><span>“Go on!” I said. The penguin stared at me and then<br/>at the pool, like he was asking, “Ah! Is this where<br/>the fish come from?” Without further encouragement,<br/>he jumped in. With a single movement of his wings,<br/>he flew like an arrow across the water and knocked<br/>into the wall on the opposite side. Luckily, he was<br/>not hurt!</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 138%;text-align: left;"><span>I had never had the opportunity to study a penguin<br/>in the water before. I was familiar with the awkward<br/>way that Juan Salvado walked on land, but now I<br/>watched in awe. Using only a stroke or two, he flew<br/>at great speed from one end of the pool to the<br/>other, turning swiftly before touching the sides. It<br/>was amazing! Everyone could see how much he was<br/>enjoying himself.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 137%;text-align: left;"><span>“Ooh! Aah!” The boys shouted, as though they were<br/>watching a fireworks display. After a while, Diego<br/>came over and asked quietly, “Can I swim, too?”</span></p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 135%;text-align: left;"><span>I was astonished. He had never gone near the pool<br/>before. I was not even sure if he could swim.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 135%;text-align: left;"><span>“The water is cold, and it’s getting late. Are you sure<br/>you want to go in?” I asked.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 18pt;text-align: left;">“Please!” “All right then,” I said, “but be quick!”</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 135%;text-align: left;"><span>I had never seen him so excited before. His eyes<br/>were shining with joy, and he seemed to be truly<br/>alive for the first time. Without hesitating, he dived<br/>into the cold water. I was ready to jump in and<br/>rescue him if he could not swim.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 135%;text-align: left;"><span>However, I soon realized that I did not have anything<br/>to worry about. Not only could Diego swim, but he<br/>swam magnificently! He chased after Juan Salvado,<br/>and they swam in perfect harmony. It was like a</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 135%;text-align: left;"><span>duet written for violin and piano. Sometimes Juan<br/>Salvado took the lead and Diego followed after him.<br/>At other times Diego went ahead and the penguin<br/>swam around the boy. Occasionally they swam so<br/>close that they almost touched.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 135%;text-align: left;"><span>I was almost speechless. Suddenly Diego was not the<br/>sad little boy we had become used to. He was a<br/>very normal boy with a very special talent.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;"><span>“Diego! You can swim!”<br/>“Yes, I can swim.”</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 135%;text-align: left;"><span>“I mean you are able to swim really well. Brilliantly,<br/>in fact!”</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 135%;text-align: left;"><span>“Do you think so?” He asked without looking directly<br/>at me, but I saw a smile on his face.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 138%;text-align: left;"><span>As we returned to the dormitory, Diego told me that<br/>his father had taught him how to swim in the river<br/>by their home. It was the first time he had talked<br/>about his life. I listened in silence, without making<br/>any corrections to his English, as he talked nonstop<br/>all the way back to the dormitory.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 138%;text-align: left;"><span>The events of that day were extraordinary. A child<br/>had gone down to the water to swim with a<br/>penguin, and shortly afterward, a young man had<br/>emerged. The ugly duckling had become a swan.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 138%;text-align: left;"><span>It was definitely a turning point. Diego’s confidence<br/>grew quickly after that day. When the school had a<br/>swimming competition, he won every race he<br/>participated    in. The encouragement and<br/>acknowledgement   given by the other boys was<br/>genuine.                 He had earned the respect of his<br/>classmates. Over the next few weeks, his grades<br/>improved and he became more popular. Thanks to a<br/>swim with a penguin, a lonely boy’s life was changed<br/>forever.</span></p></body></html>
