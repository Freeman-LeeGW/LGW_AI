She wrote a report about her experience<br/>to share with her class.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 138%;text-align: left;"><span>Last week, I visited an exhibition of artwork and<br/>ancient items selected from the Kansong Art<br/>Museum’s collection. The exhibition included<br/>information about the man who gathered all of the<br/>artwork displayed there. His name was Jeon<br/>Hyeongpil, but he is better known by his pen name,<br/>Kansong. He was born into a rich family in 1906 and<br/>lived through the Japanese occupation of Korea. At<br/>the age of 24, he inherited a massive fortune. After<br/>carefully thinking about what he could do for his<br/>country, he decided to use the money to protect<br/>Korea’s cultural heritage from the Japanese. This<br/>decision was greatly influenced by his mentor, Oh<br/>Sechang, who was an independence activist and had<br/>keen insight into Korean art. With Oh’s guidance and<br/>his own convictions, Kansong devoted most of his<br/>fortune to acquiring old books, paintings, and other<br/>works of art. He considered these items the pride of<br/>the nation and believed they represented the national<br/>spirit. Without his actions, they would have been<br/>destroyed or taken overseas.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: left;"><span>As soon as I walked in, I could not help but admire<br/>some ink-andwater paintings by Jeong Seon, a<br/>famous Korean artist also known as Gyeomjae. These<br/>paintings were kept in an album called the *</span><span class="s1">Haeak<br/>jeonsincheop</span><span>. They depict the beautiful scenery of<br/>Geumgangsan Mountain and its surrounding areas.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 132%;text-align: left;"><span>The way Gyeomjae painted the mountains, rivers, and<br/>valleys    makes them look very inviting. I was shocked<br/>when the museum tour guide said that the album<br/>was almost burned as kindling. Fortunately, it was<br/>rescued at the last minute and later purchased by<br/>Kansong. Knowing that these beautiful paintings were<br/>nearly turned to ashes made me feel very sad. I am<br/>thankful that these paintings are still around so that<br/>future generations can also appreciate them.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: left;"><span>The next item that impressed me was a gorgeous<br/>porcelain vase called the *</span><span class="s1">Celadon Prunus Vase with<br/>Inlaid Cloud and Crane Design</span><span>. It is a pleasant shade<br/>of green, with a lovely pattern of clouds and cranes<br/>encircling the entire vase. The cranes seem to be<br/>alive       and stretching their wings in search of freedom.<br/>Kansong bought the vase from a Japanese art dealer<br/>in 1935. With the money he spent on it, Kansong<br/>could have bought 20 nice houses! Later, a different<br/>Japanese collector offered double the price Kansong<br/>had paid for the vase. However, Kansong refused to<br/>part with it because he knew that it was the most<br/>magnificent vase of its kind. Today it is listed as one<br/>of Korea’s National Treasures. Seeing it in person was<br/>an absolutely breathtaking experience!</span></p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 137%;text-align: left;"><span>Finally, I saw the one item in the museum that I will<br/>never forget – an original copy of the</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 137%;text-align: left;">*<span class="s1">Hunminjeongeum Haerye</span><span>. This ancient book was<br/>written in 1446, and it explains the ideas and<br/>principles behind the creation of Hangeul, the writing<br/>system of the Korean language. It was found in<br/>Andong in 1940. At that time, however, Korea was<br/>still occupied by Japan. The Japanese colonial<br/>government intended to get rid of the Korean<br/>language. Schools were forbidden to teach lessons in<br/>Korean, and scholars who studied Korean were<br/>arrested.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;"><span>From the moment he heard that the<br/></span><span class="s1">Hunminjeongeum Haerye </span><span>had been discovered,<br/>Kansong           couldn’t stop thinking about it. He knew he<br/>had to protect it at all costs. After years of waiting,<br/>he was finally able to obtain the book. He purchased<br/>it at ten times the price the owner was asking and<br/>carefully hid it in his house. When the Japanese were<br/>finally defeated, he was able to share it with the rest<br/>of Korea. The guide said that the </span><span class="s1">Hunminjeongeum<br/>Haerye </span>is the museum’s most precious treasure.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 138%;text-align: left;"><span>Without it, the origins and fundamentals of Hangeul<br/>would have been lost to history. It has since been<br/>designated a National Treasure of Korea and included<br/>in       the UNESCO Memory of the World Register.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 137%;text-align: left;"><span>Looking at the ancient book, I could feel Kansong’s<br/>strong commitment to preserving Korean history.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 138%;text-align: left;"><span>Standing in the middle of the exhibition hall,<br/>surrounded by Korean art, I could not stop thinking<br/>about Kansong. He was an amazing person! He did<br/>not collect art for his personal enjoyment. He did it<br/>to protect Korea’s cultural identity during the harsh<br/>Japanese colonial period. After Korea regained its<br/>independence, he stopped collecting art, as he knew<br/>it         would safely remain in Korea. During our country’s<br/>worst time, a single man was able to defend Korea’s<br/>national spirit and pride. Thanks to him, we are still<br/>able to experience an essential part of Korean culture<br/>today.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 138%;text-align: left;"><span>Founded in 1938, the Kansong Art Museum was<br/>Korea’s first private museum. When Kansong built it,<br/>he named it Bohwagak. He used the building as a<br/>place to store all of the important cultural items he<br/>had collected over the years. Kansong died in 1962,<br/>and Bohwagak was renamed the Kansong Art<br/>Museum in 1966. It now holds about 5,000 items,<br/>including 12 Korean National Treasures.</span></p></body></html>
